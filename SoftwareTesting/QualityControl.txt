	4.It always involves executing a program
	5.It's a Corrective technique
	6.It's a Reactive measure
	7.It is the procedure to verify that deliverables
	8.QC involves in full software testing life cycle
	9.QC confirms that the standards are followed while working on the product
	10.It is performed only after QA activity is done
	11.It is a High-Level Activity, it can identify an error that QA cannot
